INTRODUCTION


The purpose of this book is to give schoolgirls definite help in
learning how to keep themselves and other children well and happy.

The problem is a double one: How can we best safeguard the health of
our schoolgirls? and What can we do through them to save the babies?
To the first question the answer is that we can teach the girls the
sacredness of life by instructing them in personal hygiene and in the
care of the home. The object of such instruction is to give each girl a
“sound mind in a sound body” and to fit her for a woman’s work in the
world. The solution of the second part of the problem is to be found
in the careful training of the schoolgirl in the general principles of
hygiene as applied to babies.

Because the Health League classes reach the girls during their
formative years, they offer a splendid opportunity to establish those
habits of life that make for health and consequent happiness and
usefulness. Now as never before we are coming to realize that the
strength of a nation depends primarily on the spiritual and physical
health of its citizens and also on the training of its children to
assume in later years their duties as fathers and mothers.

The author wishes to express her appreciation and gratitude to the many
persons who have manifested interest in the work of the Girls’ Health
League, which was launched under the auspices of the Massachusetts
State Federation of Women’s Clubs. She wishes also especially to thank
the following: Mrs. Herbert J. Gurney, President of the Massachusetts
State Federation of Women’s Clubs, for her encouragement; Dr.
Payson Smith, Commissioner of Education of Massachusetts, for his
indorsement; John B. Hawes, 2d, M. D., for his criticism and advice;
Margaret V. Grogan, M. D., for her medical assistance; Miss Florence
Hilton, Director of Physical Education, Framingham public schools, for
illustrations of posture; G. W. Cokell of Framingham for photographic
work of unusual value; the Tri-Ad Studio artists for their excellent
designs.

FOREWORD


May this little book go forth bearing words of healing, health, and joy
to you who faithfully study them, and, also, to those little ones whom
the kind Father may place in your arms in the wonderful years to come.

CHILDREN WELL AND HAPPY




CHAPTER I

PERSONAL HYGIENE


  =Suggestions for demonstrations. 1.= Demonstrate the correct posture
  when standing, walking, and sitting. =2.= Show the right and wrong
  kinds of shoes. =3.= Demonstrate the correct way of carrying
  schoolbooks. =4.= Show samples of soap—pure castile, Ivory, and a
  cheap scented variety—and explain the right and wrong uses of soap.

Personal hygiene may be defined as the wise and systematic care of the
body. The reasons why every girl should take care of her body are:

First, good health means power to do one’s work in life well.

Second, health is an aid to happiness and personal attractiveness.

[Illustration: CORRECT POSTURE WHEN STANDING]

Good health helps to give a person an active, cheerful mind, and this
makes one alert, capable, and able to work to the best advantage. Good
health gives poise and grace to the body and helps to create efficiency.

The following are good rules:

1. Form health-giving habits.

2. Let keeping well and happy be one of your most important duties.

The person who honestly wishes to be useful must begin at once to make
good health a certainty.


RULES FOR CORRECT POSTURE

=Standing.= We should stand correctly in order that the organs of the
body—heart, lungs, stomach, liver, and kidneys—may have room and be in
position to do their work well. We should stand erect, chin in, chest
high, abdomen flat, and with the weight of the body resting on the
balls of the feet.

=Walking.= In walking the weight of the body should be thrown well
forward.

It is correct to let the heel touch the ground first, but the weight
should very quickly be transferred to the ball of the foot. The correct
position of the feet is with the toes pointed straight forward. This
straight-foot position is characteristic of our best athletes, our
native Indians, and others who are noted for great endurance in running
and walking. Two things are essential: stockings should be a little
longer than the feet, and shoes should be roomy at the toes and have
heels not more than one inch high.

=Sitting.= As our schoolgirls sit many hours each day, it is vital
to their health that they sit correctly. When sitting, one should
push back in the chair as far as possible. In the resting position
the entire trunk should lean backwards against the back of the chair;
the hips should not be allowed to slide forward in the seat. In the
active position the trunk is held erect or inclined forward. When
leaning forward in a sitting position, the trunk must be held erect or
inclined forward, and the bending should be from the hips, not from the
waistline. Girls should not sit on one foot nor with the knees crossed,
as these positions interfere with the circulation. When a person is
sitting, the feet may be crossed if a change of position is desired.

[Illustration: WRONG WAY TO CARRY SCHOOLBOOKS

RIGHT WAY TO CARRY SCHOOLBOOKS]

=Carrying of schoolbooks.= In going to and from school, books should
be carried on the right arm one day, on the left arm the next day, or
they may be divided and carried partly on each arm. Of course the best
plan is not to carry many books home. All pupils should prepare as many
lessons during the study periods of each school day as classes will
permit.

=Position when reading.= Children should be taught at an early age not
to let the light, either natural or artificial, shine in their eyes.
The strongest light should come from the left. Light from above is the
best. One should not read too long at any one time without looking up
at some distant object in order to rest the muscles of the eyes.


CARE OF THE SKIN

The skin is the outer covering of the body. It serves as a protection
to the body and as an organ of excretion. Many waste products which
would act as poisons if retained in the body are carried away through
the pores of the skin by means of perspiration. This perspiration is
produced by sweat-producing glands. Closely related to these are the
oil-producing glands. The constant presence of perspiration and oily
material from the glands makes it important that the skin be kept clean
so that the pores may not become clogged.

SECTION OF THE SKIN]

=Handkerchiefs.= It is important that the child be supplied with
clean handkerchiefs and be taught the proper use of them. A child
should be told never to use a handkerchief belonging to anyone else. A
handkerchief should be held before the nose or mouth when coughing or
sneezing. One should never spit on the sidewalk, in the house, or in
any public place.


BATHS

=Cleansing bath.= The most important bath is the cleansing bath of warm
water and soap, which should be taken at night or after exercise. After
taking this bath one should dash or rub cold water over the skin. The
body should be quickly dried and given a brisk rubbing with a coarse
towel to increase the circulation.

=Cold bath.= A cool sponge bath, taken the first thing in the morning,
has a stimulating effect on the body. It sends the blood to the skin
and quickens the circulation. This bath should be followed by a brisk
rubdown with a rough towel. A cold plunge bath should not be taken
without the advice of a physician, as cold baths are not beneficial to
everyone.

[Illustration: THE CORRECT KIND OF TOOTHBRUSH]

=Brushing the teeth.= The greatest factor in preventing decay of the
teeth is cleanliness. The teeth should be brushed the first thing
in the morning and the last thing at night, and, when convenient,
should be rinsed after eating. The lower teeth should be brushed with
a half-rotary motion up, and the upper teeth should be brushed down.
This will assist in removing particles of food from the teeth and will
prevent injury to the gums. Dental floss should be used between the
teeth. Coarse food which requires much chewing strengthens the teeth
and is excellent for the digestion.

It is well to use a simple mouth wash of one-half teaspoonful of soda
or salt in a glass of tepid water. Have the dentist clean the teeth
twice a year; do not wait until the teeth ache before going to the
dentist.


FOOD

Food is that which supplies nourishment to our bodies. Although many
elements enter into the composition of what we eat, food is roughly
divided into three classes: proteids, carbohydrates, and fats. Some
foods contain all of these elements; others contain only one or two of
them.

=Proteids.= The proteids build and repair the tissues of the body and
include such substances as the lean of meat and fish, the white of
egg, milk, and parts of vegetables. Dried peas, dried beans, and nuts
contain large percentages of proteid.

=Carbohydrates (sugars and starches).= Carbohydrates form the essential
parts of vegetables and furnish body heat and muscular power. Foods
containing a large percentage of starch are bread, potatoes, rice,
macaroni, tapioca, and cereals. Such foods as candy, maple sirup,
honey, and molasses are almost entirely sugar; while carrots, parsnips,
and beets contain a large percentage of sugar.

=Fats.= Fats are the energy-producing part of our diet. They may be
of either vegetable or animal origin—as cream, butter, yolks of eggs,
nuts, meat, and fish fats.

=Mixed diet.= A mixed diet consisting of all the food elements in
proper proportion is necessary to supply material for the normal growth
of the body. Everyone should eat vegetables freely not only because
they are good for the bowels (acting as a wholesome laxative) but
also because many of them, especially the green vegetables, contain
important organic matter, such as iron.

=Bread and butter.= Bread has often been called the staff of life. In
other words, bread and butter alone form an almost perfectly balanced
meal. Bread should never be eaten until it is at least twenty-four
hours old. Stale bread cut thin and toasted in the oven until it is
crisp is appetizing and wholesome. Instead of giving large amounts
of bread and butter to children three times a day, mothers should
substitute in part vegetables and fruits.

=Coarse foods.= Coarse foods are especially valuable because they
require thorough mastication, which is the real function of the teeth.
This helps to keep the tongue and teeth clean. Another reason for
giving coarse foods to children is that the circulation of blood in the
gums and throat is improved by chewing.

=Milk.= Milk contains all the essential elements of a well-balanced
diet and is one of the most important foods. It should be taken slowly
and with other food, such as graham crackers, and should constitute
an important part of the diet of every child. Children up to fourteen
years of age should take milk, or milk flavored with cocoa, in the
place of tea and coffee.

=Water.= While water is not classed as a food, it makes up three fifths
of the total of the fluids of the body and aids in the elimination of
the waste products of the body. All foods contain some water, while
fruits and vegetables are largely composed of it. A glass of water
should be taken before breakfast, in the middle of the morning, and in
the afternoon, and two glasses in the evening. One glass may be taken
with the meals if it is taken after the food in the mouth has been
swallowed. Six or eight glasses of water should be taken during every
twenty-four hours.

=Candy.= Many people believe that candy is harmful. This is because
children, and indeed adults, are apt to eat it at the wrong time and to
eat too much of it at one time; nevertheless it has high food value,
and a little pure candy eaten once a day, after a meal, is healthful.

=Bowels.= When there is any trouble with the stomach or bowels look
for the cause in some mistake or indiscretion in the diet. The family
physician should be consulted.

=Care of the bowels.= The bowels should move at least once every day.
A regular habit of bowel movement can and should be formed. The best
time is in the morning, after breakfast. Many of the head-aches,
muddy, pimply complexions, and bad tempers are due to constipation.
This condition may be relieved by exercise, by the eating of coarse
food, vegetables, fruits, such as apples, prunes, and oranges, and by
drinking plenty of water.

=Exercise.= Exercise, as either work or play, is necessary because
it stimulates the action of all the organs of the body. The blood
circulates more freely during exercise, and more waste products are
thrown off. One should not take violent exercise immediately after
eating; neither should one exercise when unduly fatigued. Work must be
wisely alternated with play and rest, because efficiency ends when a
person becomes overtired.




CHAPTER II

HOME SANITATION

  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= =1.= Demonstrate the ventilation of
  a room. =2.= Demonstrate the dusting of a room.


By home sanitation we mean keeping the house clean and giving the
forces of nature, such as sunshine, fresh air, and pure water, their
fullest opportunity to work for us. By letting the out of doors indoors
we give nature a fairer chance at her great task of keeping us well and
happy.

The house is a protection for the family and should have healthful and
cheerful surroundings. The housewife should understand the principles
of home sanitation and thereby secure for her family a healthy and
happy life.

=Location of the house.= The location of the house is often decided
more by necessity or convenience than by the consideration of health.
If possible, a tenement or house should be so situated as to secure
good air, sunshine, good drainage, and good neighbors. A house with
a southerly exposure or placed with its corners to the points of the
compass has a distinct hygienic value and is always to be preferred,
because it gets the sun in each room at some time during the day.

=Sunshine.= Abundant sunshine and light in the home are of great
importance, and help to make the home healthful and more cheerful.
People living in rooms which have no sun become pale and gradually lose
strength.

=Pure air.= Sunshine and pure air are the most important essentials for
healthy life in the home. Nothing will take the place of fresh air.
Everyone should be taught to fill the lungs with it by slow, deep
breathing. We breathe on an average eighteen times a minute, or 25,920
times every twenty-four hours. No matter how well rooms are ventilated,
it is a good plan to open the windows wide a few times each day. This
helps to rid the atmosphere of impurities.

=Oxygen.= Oxygen is the element in the air that sustains life; it is
inhaled through the lungs, taken up by the blood, and carried to all
parts of the body.

=Carbon dioxide.= The air also contains carbon dioxide, which is a
product of combustion in many forms, such as respiration and the
decomposition of animal and vegetable matter. Although enormous
quantities of carbon dioxide are constantly being forced into the
air, it is likewise being removed constantly—especially by growing
vegetation. Plants and trees, under the influence of sunlight, absorb
much of the carbon dioxide; therefore plants, which many people like
to have in their rooms, not only please the eye but have a practical
value.

The condition of plants in the house is a good test of home sanitation.
If the leaves drop off, probably the rooms are overheated and the air
too dry. There is some truth in the saying, “Where plants will not
grow, people ought not to live.” The breathing of impure air causes
a feeling of discomfort; the habitual breathing of bad air causes
headache and lessens the resistance of the body to disease.

=Impurities of air in homes.= Many conditions may help cause bad air
in our homes; among these are mentioned overcrowding, oil stoves, gas
stoves, and the kind of housekeeping which permits the accumulation of
dust and waste.

=Good ventilation.= By good ventilation we mean a sufficient supply of
fresh air of suitable temperature and moisture, kept systematically
in motion. Moving air serves a double purpose—that of bringing to us a
fresh supply and of taking away the warm, moist, impure air by which
we are surrounded. The best and simplest way to ventilate a room is
to have one or two windows open at both the top and the bottom. During
storms or in the winter time, ventilation may be secured by covering a
wire screen with thin outing flannel. This allows the entrance of fresh
air without drafts.

[Illustration: IDEAL VENTILATION]

=Drafts.= There is a superstition that colds are caused by drafts.
As a matter of fact, moving air is a necessity, and drafts do not
cause colds. Drafts, sudden chilling of the body, and dampness may be
predisposing causes, but in themselves they will not produce a cold.
Such conditions lower the general vitality of the body and favor the
development of infection when the specific cause is introduced.

=Temperature of air.= The temperature of the air has a very important
bearing on health. The harmful effect of extremes of temperature has
caused the death of many babies. The temperature of heated rooms,
during the day, should be between 68° and 70°F.

=Humidity.= By humidity we mean the moisture in the air. Many of the
colds which occur in the winter are due to the dry air in homes and
places of work. Extreme dryness irritates the mucous membranes of the
nose and throat, and this irritation is favorable to the development
of infection. Moisture may be added to the air in two simple ways: by
keeping a dish of water on the radiator and by keeping plants in the
rooms, for plants constantly throw off moisture.

=Water.= The purity of the water that is used in the household, whether
it comes from a public water supply or from a well in the country, is
a question of great importance. Every housewife should know the source
from which the water used in her household comes.

Water is considered pure from the standpoint of health when it is free
from pollution, color, odor, poisonous salts, and turbidity. Clear,
sparkling water is not necessarily pure however. The purity of water
can be determined only by analysis.

In most states the public water supply of cities and towns is inspected
regularly and the water is examined, so that the people may be
protected from danger of infection. When the water used in a household
is obtained from a well or private water supply, an analysis of it
should be made.

All wells should be carefully constructed and covered, so that there
may be no danger of pollution from surface drainage. Privy vaults
should not be near the well or so located that there will be drainage
from them to a well; otherwise the germs of typhoid and other diseases
may find their way to it through the ground and become a source of
danger to the persons using the water. As an extra precaution all
discharges from persons who have tuberculosis, cholera, dysentery, or
typhoid fever should be effectively disinfected before they are emptied
into a privy vault or into a flush closet.

=Purification of water.= If the purity of the water is doubted, it
should be boiled for five or ten minutes in a clean, covered kettle.
This renders it safe. The flat taste which often results from the
boiling may be remedied by shaking the water in a bottle or pouring it
from one clean pitcher to another or by simply exposing it to the air
overnight. Water should be kept cool, and should be protected from dust.

=Household filters.= The domestic filter is of little value. It will
remove visible particles of matter, but will have very little effect
upon bacteria. If such filters are used, they should be carefully and
intelligently cleaned several times a day.

=Care and arrangement of rooms.= All the rooms in the house should be
well ventilated and kept scrupulously clean. The windows should be
entirely screened in order that they may be opened at both top and
bottom. The screens should be put on in the spring before the flies and
mosquitoes appear and should not be removed until all danger from them
is past. Screens should be brushed frequently.

=Dust and dusting.= Dust is brought into the home on shoes and
clothing, and is blown in from the outside. Dust must be kept under
control by the use of a vacuum cleaner, a carpet sweeper, or a damp
broom, and by good ventilation. Children should not be allowed to
remain in rooms that are being swept, for dust causes an irritation of
the eyes, nose, and throat and also is frequently a carrier of disease
germs. The dusting of furniture should be done with a damp cloth. This
will wipe off the dust and not stir it up into the air where it will
be inhaled or will settle again. A feather duster should not be used.
Dampened dusters may be prepared in the following way: spread the
dusters out smoothly on a towel that has been wrung out of hot water,
roll, and let them lie for half an hour before using.

=The cellar.= The cellar should extend under the entire house. If there
is no cellar, the space under the floor should be well ventilated.
There should be windows on at least two sides of the cellar to give
ventilation and light, and the windows should be well screened. The
cellar requires constant care and should be kept not only dry but clean
and free from rubbish and substances that decay or absorb and hold
moisture.

=Care of food.= Young people should learn to care for food in the home.
Food should be fresh, clean, and wholesome. It should be protected from
dust and handled only with clean hands. The development of bacteria
may be prevented by keeping the food cold and clean. Fruits should
be washed before being used. The outer covering of berries is easily
bruised, and such fruits are frequently contaminated by dust and flies.
Fruit should be full-grown but not over-ripe when eaten. Vegetables
such as lettuce, celery, and radishes, that are eaten uncooked, should
be thoroughly washed and rinsed in several waters.

=Care of garbage.= Garbage consists chiefly of the refuse matter
from the kitchen. It should be kept in a clean metal can with a
tight-fitting cover, since it will attract flies, rats, and other
vermin. It is important that the can be frequently emptied and
cleaned. Be careful that broken glass, broken dishes, nails, tacks, or
old papers are not mixed with the kitchen refuse. Have a separate can
or barrel for ashes and all glass and metal rubbish. The fair criterion
of good housekeeping is the amount of garbage. A large amount of
garbage means carelessness and waste in the kitchen.

=Dishcloth and dish towels.= Beware of a greasy, damp, disease-carrying
dishcloth that is hung in a warm, dark place. The dishcloth and dish
towels should be kept clean by washing them with soap and hot water
every day. They should be hung out in the sunshine in the open air.

=Clean hands.= Clean hands mean more than personal cleanliness. They
mean clean door knobs, furniture, and clothing. The hands should be
washed frequently with warm water and soap, and always before handling
food, after going to the toilet, and before taking the baby.




CHAPTER III

THE NEWBORN BABY

  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= =1.= Demonstrate the washing of
  the baby’s eyes. =2.= Demonstrate giving the baby the oil bath. =3.=
  Demonstrate giving the sponge bath. =4.= Show how to make the baby’s
  bed and how to place the baby in it.


=First care of baby.= The hands should be carefully washed before
handling the baby. When the baby comes his eyes must be washed with a
two per cent solution of boric acid.[1] The proper care of the eyes at
this time may be the means of preserving the eyesight. A fresh piece
of cotton should be used for each eye. Always wash the lids from the
nose toward the outer corner of the eye; then burn the cotton. The baby
should then be placed upon his right side, with his head a little
lower than his body.

[Footnote 1: See Appendix B, p. 109.]

=Oil bath.= When the baby is born there is on his skin, particularly in
the creases, a white cheeselike substance that can be removed only with
oil. Therefore the baby’s first bath should be of warm olive oil or
vaseline, applied with a piece of soft cotton and allowed to remain for
an hour or more and then very gently wiped off. A water bath should not
be given until the second day.

=A sponge bath.= A sponge bath should be given daily up to the sixth
or ninth day, after which the warm tub bath should be substituted.
Essentials for the bath are:

  1. A warm room (72° F.)
  2. A bath thermometer
  3. A large flannel bath apron
  4. Two basins of warm water
  5. Two soft washcloths
  6. Two large soft towels
  7. Olive-oil soap or pure castile soap
  8. Pure talcum powder
  9. Two per cent boric-acid solution
  10. Absorbent cotton

The toilet articles should be kept on a white enamel tray, which is
easy to clean. After everything is prepared for the bath the fresh
clothing should be warmed. The mother puts on her apron and takes
the baby in her lap; she then undresses him and wraps him in the
bath apron. The temperature of the bath should be 100° F. by the
thermometer, and this should never be guessed at, because the water
feels very much warmer to the sensitive skin of the baby than to the
hand of an adult. The head and face are first washed with the warm
water and carefully dried. The body is then bathed with the warm water
and soap, rinsed with clear water, wrapped in soft towels, and dried
by patting. Great care must be taken to dry thoroughly all the folds
and creases of the skin. A little lanolin or sweet oil should then be
gently rubbed into the folds or a little talcum powder may be dusted on
the neck, behind the ears, under the arms and knees, in the groin, and
on the buttocks. Wipe away all superfluous powder, as it is apt to get
wet and cake, and will then irritate the skin.

For the tub bath see page 63.

=Dressing the baby.= In dressing and undressing the baby the garment
should be put on and off over the feet. This will prevent dust or other
foreign particles on the clothing from entering the eyes, nose, or
mouth of the baby. After the baby is dressed his nose, ears, and eyes
should be cleaned by means of twisted cotton dipped in a two per cent
solution of boric acid. A fresh piece of cotton should be used for each
eye, ear, and nostril and should then be burned.


DEVELOPMENT

=Crying.= It is necessary for a newborn baby to cry a little every day;
this tends to expand his lungs.

=Sight.= A newborn baby is not able to distinguish objects, but his
eyes are very sensitive to light and must be carefully protected.

=Hearing.= The hearing soon becomes acute; therefore loud and sudden
noises should be avoided, as they startle and excite the baby. It is
well to keep him in a room away from noise and confusion.

=Speech.= When six or seven months old a baby begins to try to utter
words and will usually be able to say a few words when nine or ten
months old. The average child, however, does not begin to form
sentences of more than two or three words until he is about eighteen
months or two years of age.

[Illustration: THE BABY’S BED]

=Baby’s bed.= The newborn baby sleeps about nine tenths of the time.
He should have a bed by himself. The first bed may be made in an
ordinary clothes basket or in a light box. Table padding makes a good
mattress if folded to six thicknesses, because it is easily laundered
and is inexpensive. When washed it should be dried out of doors in the
sunshine. If the material used in the crib mattress is excelsior, it
should be made as smooth as possible, with a soft pad placed on top
of it. Curled hair is more expensive, but is light, cool, and easily
cleansed. The crib mattress should always be protected by a piece of
rubber sheeting covered with a soft pad. The baby’s bed should be
raised at least twelve inches from the floor to escape drafts.

=Pillows.= The baby’s head should not be elevated, as he will take more
air into his lungs when no pillow is used. If the mother wishes, she
may place a folded soft cloth under the baby’s head.

=Birth registration.= See that the baby’s birth is promptly and
accurately registered. Later he may need his birth certificate to prove
his

  1. Identity
  2. Legitimacy
  3. Right to inherit property
  4. Right to enter school
  5. Right to seek employment
  6. Right to vote
  7. Right to hold office
  8. Privilege to travel in other countries

               MODEL BIRTH CERTIFICATE


=Protection against flies and mosquitoes.= The baby must be protected
from flies and mosquitoes because malaria and other diseases may be
transmitted in this way. Flies are carriers of filth and disease germs
and therefore should never be allowed to touch the baby’s lips or the
baby’s bottle.

It is important that netting be placed over the baby’s bed and be large
enough to tuck in under the mattress. It should not hang down over the
sides of the bed.




CHAPTER IV

BREAST FEEDING

  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= 1. Demonstrate how to hold the baby
  when feeding him. 2. Demonstrate how to weigh the baby.


Every mother should nurse her baby if she is well and has the milk; it
is her most important duty for the time being, and all other things
should be secondary to it.

=The reasons.= Breast milk is nature’s food for the baby. It is fresh,
sterile, and always at hand. It is the least expensive food that
can be given, and contains the proper elements of food in the right
proportions.

Breast-fed babies seldom have bowel troubles—which are apt to be so
fatal in bottle-fed babies, especially in hot weather. Ten bottle-fed
babies die to one fed on the breast.

=Hours for nursing.= At the end of the first twenty-four hours the
baby is put to the breast. Because of the scant quantity of milk in
the breasts, every four or six hours is often enough for the first two
days. Until the mother’s milk comes no food should be given to the baby
except a little cool boiled water, not sweetened. If the milk is very
scanty, the physician will probably order a few bottle feedings. For a
normal baby the following feedings are recommended:

  +----------------+---------------+----------------+
  |  FROM BIRTH    |  FROM THREE   |  FROM EIGHT    |
  |  TO THREE      |  TO EIGHT     |  MONTHS TO     |
  |  MONTHS OLD    |  MONTHS OLD   |  ONE YEAR OLD  |
  +----------------+---------------+----------------+
  |  6 A. M.       |  6 A. M.      |  6 A. M.       |
  |  9 A. M.       |  9:30 A. M.   | 10 A. M.       |
  |  12 noon       |  1 P. M.      |  2 P. M.       |
  |  3 P. M.       |  4:30 P. M.   |  6 P. M.       |
  |  6 P. M.       |  8 P. M.      | 10 P. M.       |
  |  9 P. M.       |  12 midnight  |                |
  |  12 midnight   |               |                |
  +----------------+---------------+----------------+

The mother should nurse her baby regularly and give nothing between
feedings except unsweetened boiled water. If the baby is awakened at
feeding times during the day, he will soon form the habit of nursing
regularly.

=How to hold the baby.= While the baby is nursing do not hold him too
closely to the breast, as he must have plenty of air to breathe. If the
baby is nursing from the right breast, he should be held on the right
arm, and the mother’s left hand should press the breast away from the
baby’s nose.

=Length of nursing time.= The baby should not nurse more than ten
minutes at first nor more than twenty minutes at any time. He should
not be allowed to fall asleep while nursing nor be permitted to take
his meal too rapidly, as this latter may cause him to hiccup. If a
baby nurses too rapidly, withdraw the nipple from his mouth for a few
seconds. This may be done every three or four minutes.

=Baby’s stomach.= The infant generally takes more fluid at each feeding
than the stomach can hold at one time. Almost as soon as the milk
is swallowed it begins to pass into the intestines. Breast milk is
digested and passed on more rapidly than cow’s milk.

=Mixed feedings.= When the mother’s milk is of good quality, but is not
sufficient in quantity to satisfy the baby, it is necessary to give
him additional food. This is done by giving alternate feedings of the
breast milk and modified milk. Mixed feedings should always be given
under the doctor’s directions. Every bit of breast milk helps the baby,
because it tends to make the digestion of artificial food easier.

=Advice to nursing mothers.= Keep yourself well. As long as you are
well the baby will keep well. Even though you have but little milk at
first, do not get discouraged; be patient and persevering. You should
have lunches of milk and gruel—one in the middle of the morning, one
in the afternoon, and another at bedtime. Remember that an active,
cheerful mind is an important factor in good health. Nothing upsets a
baby more quickly than a nervous, irritable mother.

=Diet of a nursing woman.= The meals should be simple and nutritious
and should include a large amount of liquid. Milk, cereals, eggs, and
soups should form the principal part of the diet. Some of the foods to
be avoided by a nursing woman are cabbage, onions, garlic, and sour
fruits.

=Weaning.= The healthy baby should be weaned from the breast between
the ninth and the eleventh month. Every baby ought to be weaned
entirely at the age of one year, but it is better not to wean him
during the summer. If a baby has been taught to take water from a spoon
or cup, there will be no trouble at the weaning period in having him
take his milk from a cup. Weaning should take place gradually. During
the process the mother should take less liquids and usually some
laxative to produce free movements of the bowels.

=Weigh the baby.= The baby should be weighed once a week. Scales
similar to grocers’ scales, with a basket attached, may be used, as
they are more accurate than spring scales.

=Directions for weighing.= Have the scales in a warm place, protected
from drafts. Undress the baby, wrap him in a small blanket, and place
him in the basket on the scales. Write down the total weight; then lift
the baby out, weigh the basket and blanket together, and subtract this
amount from the first weight. The average healthy baby weighs from
seven to seven and one-half pounds at birth, and his average length is
twenty inches. A healthy baby usually doubles his weight at the end of
the fifth month, and by the end of the first year weighs three times
as much as at birth. For instance, if he weighs seven pounds at birth,
he should weigh fourteen pounds at the end of the fifth month and
twenty-one pounds at the end of the first year.

[Illustration: WEIGHING THE BABY]

If the length is twenty inches at birth, the baby should grow about
four inches during the first five months and eight inches during the
first year. The following table shows the actual gain in weight of a
healthy baby that was breast fed:

  Weight at birth                    7½    pounds
  Weight at age of two months       11¼    pounds
  Weight at age of four months      16     pounds
  Weight at age of six months       18     pounds
  Weight at age of eight months     20     pounds
  Weight at end of first year       21     pounds

A child may be in good health and yet not conform to these averages.
This need cause no uneasiness, providing the child is well and gains in
weight.




CHAPTER V

BOTTLE FEEDING

  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= =1.= Show and demonstrate the
  care of utensils to be used in modifying milk. =2.= Demonstrate
  the process of modifying milk. =3.= Demonstrate the process of
  pasteurizing milk.


=Foods.= Condensed milk and proprietary foods should be used only in
emergency or on the advice of a physician. They are of value only
in the rare instances when a baby cannot digest cow’s milk or when
prescribed by a physician.

=Cow’s milk.= If a baby cannot have breast milk, the next best food
is properly modified cow’s milk. Cow’s milk, when used for the baby,
must be fresh. It should be delivered in sealed bottles. Milk sold from
open cans should never be given to a child. Milk should not be left
standing on the doorstep nor in a warm kitchen, but should be placed in
the ice box as soon as received, where it should be kept covered and at
a temperature between 35° and 45° F.

=Choice of milk.= Whenever possible, certified milk should be used.
_Certified milk_ is milk produced under conditions that conform to
certain standards of cleanliness laid down by the state. Uncertified
milk may of course often be used without danger, but if there is any
question about its purity, it should be pasteurized (see page 52 for
directions for pasteurizing).


COMPARISON OF MOTHER’S MILK AND COW’S MILK

  +---------------+---------------+---------------+
  |               | MOTHER’S MILK |   COW’S MILK  |
  +---------------+---------------+---------------+
  | Fat           | 3.50 per cent | 4.00 per cent |
  | Sugar         | 7.00 per cent | 4.50 per cent |
  | Protein       | 1.25 per cent | 3.50 per cent |
  | Salts         |  .20 per cent |  .70 per cent |
  +---------------+---------------+---------------+

No matter how cow’s milk is modified, it differs from human milk in
certain other ways that we do not understand, and this renders it less
desirable for infant feeding than human milk.

=Modified milk.= The formula for the baby’s food must be given by a
nurse or a physician. The following general directions for feeding a
baby that does not require a special formula have been prepared by a
committee of the American Medical Association:

  Beginning on the third day the average baby should be given three
  ounces of milk daily, diluted with seven ounces of water. To this
  should be added one tablespoon of limewater and two level teaspoons
  of sugar. This should be given in seven feedings.

  At one week the average child requires five ounces of milk daily,
  which should be diluted with ten ounces of water. To this should
  be added one and one-half even teaspoons of sugar and one ounce of
  limewater. This should be given in seven feedings. The milk should
  be increased by one-half ounce about every four days. The water
  should be increased by one-half ounce every eight days.

[Illustration: MODIFICATION OF THE MILK]

  At three months the average child requires sixteen ounces of milk
  daily, which should be diluted with sixteen ounces of water. To
  this should be added three tablespoons of sugar and two ounces of
  limewater. This should be given in six feedings. The milk should
  be increased by one-half ounce every six days. The water should be
  reduced by one-half ounce about every two weeks.

  At six months the average child requires twenty-four ounces of milk
  daily, which should be diluted with twelve ounces of water. To this
  should be added two ounces of limewater and three even tablespoons
  of sugar. This should be given in five feedings. The amount of milk
  should be increased by one-half ounce every week. The milk should be
  increased only if the child is hungry and digesting his food well. It
  should not be increased unless he is hungry, nor if he is suffering
  from indigestion, even though he seems hungry.

  At nine months the average child requires thirty ounces of milk
  daily, which should be diluted with ten ounces of water. To this
  should be added two even tablespoons of sugar and two ounces of
  limewater. This should be given in five feedings. The sugar added
  may be milk sugar or, if this cannot be obtained, cane (granulated)
  sugar or maltose (malt sugar). At first plain water should be used to
  dilute the milk.

  At three months, sometimes earlier, a weak barley water may be used
  in the place of plain water; it is made of one-half level tablespoon
  of barley flour to sixteen ounces of water and cooked for twenty
  minutes. (See Appendix B.)

  Fill the feeding bottles, cork them, and put on the ice. If the milk
  is not certified, it should be pasteurized.

=Utensils.= The utensils used for preparing the baby’s food should be
reserved exclusively for that purpose. The best material for these
utensils is enamel or agateware.


LIST OF UTENSILS

  1. A big covered kettle or dish pan. This should measure at least
  eighteen inches in diameter, so that all other utensils may be boiled
  in it at one time.

  2. Bottles. There should be as many bottles as there are feedings in
  one day.

  3. Nipples. It is important to select those that can be turned wrong
  side out to be cleaned.

  4. A bottle brush.

  5. A nipple brush.

  6. A sixteen-ounce graduated measuring glass.

  7. A tablespoon, teaspoon, and cream dipper.

  8. A teapot of enamel or agateware in which sterile water is kept for
  use as needed.

  9. A wire rack for holding bottles.

  10. A roll of nonabsorbent cotton for the stoppers for the feeding
  bottles.

=Pasteurizing.= This process consists of heating the milk to 145° F.
and keeping it at this temperature for thirty minutes. The following
method may be used: Fill the bottles with the modified milk and place
in the wire rack. Put the rack in a dish of water, with the water
just above the level of the milk. Suspend a milk thermometer in the
water and heat until the thermometer registers 145° F. Keep at this
temperature for thirty minutes, then take out the rack and cork the
bottles at once. Place carefully in a dish of cool water or put an
inverted basin over the rack containing the bottles and set under the
cold-water faucet. Cool quickly and place on the ice at once.

[Illustration: PASTEURIZING THE BABY’S MILK]

If no pasteurizing outfit is at hand, the bottles of milk may be
heated in a double boiler until the steam arises. Continue heating at
this temperature for fifteen minutes. If the pasteurized milk is used
for a long time, it is well to give the baby orange juice to prevent
rickets and scurvy. This should be given in the morning, regularly,
three quarters of an hour before feeding time. One teaspoonful should
be given at first, and the amount gradually increased up to one
tablespoonful.




CHAPTER VI

CARE OF THE BABY’S FOOD


  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= =1.= Show a homemade refrigerator.
  =2.= Demonstrate the care of bottles. =3.= Demonstrate the care of
  rubber nipples. =4.= Demonstrate the process of sterilizing water.

=Homemade refrigerator.= An ice box to keep the baby’s milk in good
condition may be made in the following way at very little cost: In a
wooden box about eighteen inches square and of about the same depth,
put a layer of sawdust three inches deep. Then put a ten-quart pail
(or a larger one) in the center of the box. Add more sawdust and put
a cardboard collar around the pail, to keep the sawdust in place. It
is also well to put a layer of cheesecloth over the sawdust. Inside
this pail place another (smaller) one, to hold the ice. The bottles are
put in the larger pail, which should be securely covered, and a bag of
sawdust is placed over it. The box should be tightly closed by a wooden
cover lined with several thicknesses of newspaper. The inner pail
should be taken out and cleaned every morning.

HOMEMADE REFRIGERATOR]

The box described above will keep cold for twenty-four hours with five
cents’ worth of ice in it. The cover should not be left off any longer
than is necessary to remove the bottles.

[Illustration: FILLING THE BABY’S BOTTLES]

=Care of bottles.= New bottles should be placed in a kettle of cold
water, put on the stove, and boiled for twenty minutes. They should
then be removed from the stove, but left in the kettle until the water
cools. Bottles treated in this way will not break easily.

As soon as the baby has finished feeding, the bottles should be rinsed
with cold water, cleaned with a bottle brush in clear hot water, then
filled with fresh water and set aside. In the morning, before the day’s
food is prepared, all bottles should be scrubbed with hot water and
Ivory soap; they should then be rinsed thoroughly in several waters,
boiled in a solution consisting of two teaspoonfuls of soda to one
quart of water, and rinsed in clear boiled water.

=Care of bottle nipples.= New nipples should always be scrubbed and
boiled for three minutes before being used. It is better to buy
nipples that can be turned inside out. There should always be at least
two nipples clean and ready for use. Immediately after the feeding
the nipple should be removed from the bottle, washed in cold water,
scrubbed inside and outside, rinsed well, and placed in a jar of
sterile water or a two per cent solution of boric acid. Nipples should
be boiled daily for about three minutes.

When it is time to feed the baby the bottle should be taken from the
ice box and placed (still corked) in a dish of water deep enough to
come above the milk line. The water is to be heated until the milk
is warmed. The water should not boil, as that renders the milk less
easy to digest and is apt to make the baby constipated. A clean cloth
should be placed in the bottom of the dish or kettle, to prevent the
bottle from slipping and breaking. The temperature of the milk should
be tested by dropping some of it on the inner surface of the arm. If it
feels warm to the skin, it is the correct temperature for the baby.

The mother should never put the nipple into her own mouth to test the
temperature. The nipple should be handled only by the neck; the part
that goes into the baby’s mouth should never be touched.

[Illustration: TESTING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MILK]

=Holding the baby while feeding.= The baby should be held by the mother
or nurse in the same position as for breast feeding. The bottle should
be held so that the neck is continually filled, in order that the baby
may not suck in air. The feeding should be finished in twenty minutes.
If the baby nurses too rapidly, withdraw the nipple for a moment
several times during the feeding. If the baby falls asleep, the bottle
should be removed, and no more milk should be given until the next
feeding time; he should not be permitted to nurse a little and then
sleep a little, and thus unduly prolong the feeding.

[Illustration: CORRECT WAY TO HOLD THE BABY WHILE FEEDING]

=Sterile water to drink.= The water which is given the baby to drink
should first be boiled and then put where it will cool. Before it is
given it should be slightly warmed.




CHAPTER VII

CARE OF THE BABY’S BODY


  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= =1.= Demonstrate the preparation of
  a two per cent solution of boric acid. =2.= Demonstrate giving the
  baby a tub bath. =3.= Demonstrate giving the baby a bran bath. =4.=
  Demonstrate protecting the baby from drafts.

=Preparation for the bath.= A tub bath may be given to the baby as
early as the sixth or ninth day. The morning bath should be given three
quarters of an hour before the nine o’clock feeding. The mother should
wash her hands carefully before handling the baby. The temperature of
the room in which the bath is given should not be below 72° F. If the
room is too hot—so hot that the baby perspires—there is grave danger of
his being chilled when the bath is over.

[Illustration: BATHING THE BABY]

The tub should never be put on the floor, but always on a chair or low
table. This makes it easier for the mother to give the bath and also
helps protect the baby from dust and drafts. Screens should be used
to secure complete protection from drafts. For the first four weeks
the temperature of the water should be between 98° and 100° F. As the
baby grows older the temperature should be gradually lowered. Suitable
temperatures are

  100° F. at birth
   98° F. at one month
   95° F. at three months
   90° F. at six months
   85° F. at twelve months

If the baby is bluish and does not react well, it means that the water
was not the right temperature or that he was in the water too long.
Always use a bath thermometer; never guess at the temperature.

After everything is prepared for the bath and the clean clothing
warmed, undress the baby. He should be weighed once a week, at this
time.

=The bath.= He should then be wrapped in a warm blanket and held in the
lap while his eyes, ears, nose, face, and head are washed.

_The nose and the ears._ The inside of the baby’s nose should be
carefully cleaned every day with a soft, wet twist of absorbent cotton.
The external ears should be washed daily. No attempt should be made to
clean the inside of the ears except with a piece of cotton wound around
the end of the little finger.

_The eyes._ The eyes should be cleaned each morning, at first with a
two per cent solution of boric acid, and after two months with warm
sterile water. A separate piece of cotton should be used for each eye.
The lids should be washed from the nose toward the outer corner of the
eye. If the eyes show a mattery secretion and the lids are swollen, a
physician should be consulted at once. Infection of the eyes has often
resulted in blindness.

_The mouth._ The baby’s mouth should be cleaned once a day by the use
of a swab, made by twisting a bit of absorbent cotton on a wooden
toothpick, wet in a two per cent solution of boric acid. After each
feeding a teaspoonful of warm, sterile water may be given to wash the
milk down. The old method of cleansing the mouth with a piece of gauze
twisted over the finger frequently injured the delicate tissues. Except
in emergency the finger should not be put inside the baby’s mouth.

_The scalp._ For the first few weeks the baby’s scalp should be washed
at the time of the bath. If yellow scales form, rub warm olive oil or
vaseline into the scalp at night, and in the morning wash it with warm
water and pure castile soap, rinsing thoroughly. If the scales do not
come off, repeat the operation as many times as necessary. Do not use a
comb to remove the scales, as this will irritate the scalp and render
the condition worse.

_The nails._ The baby’s nails should be cleaned with a toothpick over
which has been twisted a little absorbent cotton. The nails should
be carefully cut with small scissors in order to prevent him from
scratching himself.

_The body._ It is best to wash the baby’s entire body with warm water
and soap before placing him in the tub. The bath in the tub is for
rinsing off the soap and for exercise. He should be turned over so
that his chest will rest on the mother’s forearm while his feet touch
the bottom of the tub. Teach the baby to like the bath, and he will
not be frightened. He should not stay in the water more than two or
three minutes, and when lifted out should be wrapped in a soft, warm
bath towel. He should be dried quickly by gently patting the skin with
soft towels, not by wiping. Take special care to dry all the folds
and creases; rub these with sweet oil or lanolin, or powder them
carefully. Powder, if used, should be lightly dusted on the neck,
behind the ears, under the arms and knees, in the groin, and on the
buttocks. Rub off all superfluous powder; if it gets wet and hardens,
it will irritate the skin.

_Dressing._ The baby should always be dressed while lying on his back
or on a bed or pillow. Pin the flannel band at the side with small
safety pins; then put on the shirt and be careful that the draw string
at the neck is not tied too tightly. Next put on the diaper snugly.
The gertrude is placed inside the slip and both are put on at the same
time. These two garments should be drawn on over the baby’s feet. If
the weather is cool, the baby should be wrapped in a flannel blanket.

_Bran bath._ If the baby’s skin is sensitive or if he has heat rash, a
bran bath will prove beneficial. Prepare this by putting bran into a
cheesecloth bag six inches square, and soaking this in the bath until
the water is milky. Do not use soap with the bran bath, nor with an
ordinary bath when the baby’s skin is sensitive.




CHAPTER VIII

THE BABY’S CLOTHING


  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= =1.= Show samples of clothing for
  a baby. =2.= Demonstrate how to dress a baby in hot weather. =3.=
  Demonstrate how to dress a baby in cold weather.

=Clothes.= The clothing must always be roomy and loose and adapted to
the season, climate, and temperature.


FIRST SET OF CLOTHES

  Four flannel binders
  Four knitted bands
  Three shirts and three nightgowns
  Three flannel gertrudes
  Three dozen diapers
  Four long white dresses

=Flannel bands.= These bands should be made of all-wool flannel, four
inches wide and about twenty-eight inches long, that is, long enough
to reach twice around the baby’s body. They should have no hems and
should be fastened at the left side with small safety pins. Bands must
be adjusted with great care; they should not be drawn too tightly, but
should be made so snug that they will neither slip down and bind the
baby’s legs nor slip up and interfere with the expansion of the chest.

[Illustration: BABY CLOTHES]

=Knitted bands.= Knitted bands may be of wool and cotton or of silk and
wool. Next to the smallest size is the most practical one to buy. It
should fit snugly, should not wrinkle, and should not have rough seams.

=Shirts.= Baby shirts come in several sizes and weights. It is well to
begin with the second size, as the first size is so soon outgrown. They
should be high-necked, long-sleeved, and should open all the way down
the front. Silk and wool is the best material because it is light in
weight and wears well. The lightest weight should be worn in summer, a
little heavier weight in the spring and fall, and a still heavier in
the winter. There is a tendency in winter time to use shirts that are
too heavy. The result is that the baby perspires too freely. This makes
his clothing damp and renders him more liable to take cold. Babies
living in overheated houses and wearing clothing that is too warm
soon become sensitive to cold and drafts and are less able to resist
sickness.

=Flannel gertrudes.= The gertrudes should be made of all-wool flannel
or of wool and cotton. They should open on the shoulders.

=Dresses.= The dresses should be simply made of soft material. They
should be laundered without starch. Both the shirt and the dress should
be loose around the baby’s neck and arms, since any tightness or
roughness in the clothing may irritate the skin.

=Nightgowns.= Nightgowns may be made of flannel, stockinet, cotton,
or flannelette. The winter nightgowns should be long enough to allow
the bottom to be closed by a draw string. This will make sure that
the baby’s feet are covered at all times even if he kicks off his
bedclothes.

=Diapers.= Diapers should be made of bird’s-eye linen, cotton, or
stockinet. For a young baby they should measure about eighteen or
twenty inches square and be folded but once. Never use a folded inside
diaper, as a wad of thick material between the legs is injurious. A
small inside folded cloth five inches square may be used, or a quilted
pad about ten inches square may be laid under the baby after the diaper
is on. This pad will protect the skirts from urine. During the mother’s
waking hours the diaper should be changed as often as it is wet or
soiled. In the night it should be changed when the baby is taken up for
feeding or if he is restless.

All diapers should be washed each time after they become wet. The soap
used in washing them should be carefully rinsed out, and they should
be boiled thoroughly at least twice a week. A careless soaking and
wringing through one or two waters is not an adequate cleansing. Care
must be taken in selecting the soap to be used in washing the diapers,
since some soaps will cause an irritation of the skin, even when the
clothing has been well rinsed.

=Stockings.= It is important to keep the baby’s legs and feet warm.
Stockings and diapers should meet. In cold weather the baby should wear
stockings; in summer he will not require any covering for his feet.

=Short clothes.= The baby should be put into short clothes about the
fifth month, for at that time he begins to show signs of wanting to
use his legs and to kick. It is not wise, however, to make this change
during very cold weather.

=Clothing in summer.= The greatest care should be taken to see that the
baby is not dressed too warmly in summer. Too heavy clothing whether in
summer or in winter will make him perspire too freely and render him
more liable to colds and bowel troubles. The mother should feel of his
body occasionally; if she finds it constantly moist, the clothing is
too warm. In summer only the thinnest undershirts should be worn, and
warmer outer garments should be added as it grows cool toward night.
Light-weight knitted or crocheted jackets are easily made.

=Clothing in winter.= Clothing should always be adapted to the season.
If the baby is not dressed warmly enough, he will have cold hands and
feet, and his legs and arms will be bluish. A baby must have fresh air,
but his body must be kept warm. This is most important; unless this
is done his vital force will be lessened and he will not gain as he
should. When taken out he must be warmly dressed with a long woolen or
wool-lined coat with a shoulder cape. In cold weather a silk cap with a
lining of wool is best. Take care that the neck of the coat and the cap
ribbons are not too tight. Leggings will be necessary after the baby is
in short clothes.




CHAPTER IX

HABITS AND TRAINING


  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= =1.= Demonstrate how to protect
  a baby from flies and mosquitoes when sleeping. =2.= Show how to
  support a baby over a chamber.

Do not forget that during infancy life’s habits are being formed and
that this period is of greater educational importance than any other of
his life.

The normal baby is well and happy. Babies who are properly fed and
kept clean, who have plenty of sleep and fresh air and are trained in
regular habits, are usually well and good-natured. On the other hand,
if babies are fussy and restless most of the time, there is something
wrong. Patiently search for the cause of the trouble and see that it is
removed.

=Sleep.= A newborn baby sleeps about nine tenths of the time. He should
not be disturbed except for necessary care. After he has been made
comfortable and fed he should be laid in his crib and trained to go to
sleep without rocking and without a pacifier of any kind.

The daily amount of sleep required for different ages is approximately
as follows:

  First month                18 to 20 hours
  Second to sixth month      16 to 18 hours
  Sixth month                14 to 16 hours
  One to two years           12 to 14 hours

During the first year a nap in the middle of the forenoon, and another
in the afternoon, is desirable. The afternoon nap should not be so late
as to interfere with the night’s sleep.

A healthy baby sleeps with his mouth closed. Mouth breathing is caused
by some obstruction in the air passages, usually enlarged tonsils or
adenoids. Other signs of the presence of adenoids may be restlessness
at night, snoring during sleep, or frequent attacks of head colds. When
any one of these symptoms is present the child should be placed under a
physician’s care at once; otherwise its normal growth and health may be
seriously retarded.

  Left, normal; right, abnormal]

The sleeping room should be dark, well ventilated, and quiet. The baby
should always be protected from drafts, but the air should be fresh
and cool. After being fed he should be placed on his side, and after
the next feeding, laid on the opposite side.

=Sleeping out.= After a baby is six weeks old he should take his naps
out of doors when the weather permits. He should be protected from
flies and mosquitoes and shielded from the sun, wind, and dust. Remove
the shoes and loosen the clothing before placing him in his crib. If
the weather is cool, his feet and body must be kept warm.

=Bowel movement.= The baby’s first stools are of tarlike consistency,
with little or no odor. After a day or two the stools change to a light
yellow in color, are soft in consistency, and have little or no odor.
During the first week the bowels move two or three times a day. As the
child grows older, one or two movements a day will be sufficient.

The mother should begin to train the baby to use a chamber as early as
the third month. He should be placed on a small chamber held between
the mother’s knees, his back being supported against her body. In order
to form the habit of having the bowels move regularly this should be
done at the same hour each day. If the bowels do not move, insert a
soap or glycerine suppository into the rectum. This will help direct
the baby’s attention to the reason for his being placed on the vessel,
and the suppository starts the bowels moving. This habit is soon
established. The child should be placed on the chamber after the early
morning feeding and again in the afternoon.

=Bladder.= Habits of regularity in emptying the bladder may be formed
by placing the baby on the vessel every three or four hours during the
day and the last thing at night.

=Thumb sucking.= The habit of thumb or finger sucking begins in early
infancy and may continue until the child is six or eight years old if
it is not broken. If persisted in, it may cause marked deformities of
the jaws and teeth. When the thumb or finger is put into the mouth it
should be gently but firmly removed. By this method the habit will be
gradually overcome. It may be necessary to pin the sleeves to the side
of the dress, so that the arms cannot be raised.

=Pacifier.= Never use a rubber nipple, sugar ball, or any other
pacifier.

=Kissing.= Under no circumstances should anyone kiss a baby on the
mouth. Common colds, tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, measles,
and many other diseases are transmitted in this way. Remember that
disease may be present in the secretions of the mouth and nose and on
the lips.

=Crying.= A well baby never cries without cause. Normal crying is
loud and forceful, and the mother will soon learn to distinguish it
from the cry of pain, hunger, or discomfort. A baby has no other way
of expressing his needs—therefore his cry should be heeded. When he
cries the mother should see that he is made comfortable, that his hands
and feet are warm, that his diaper is not wet, and that no pins are
pricking him. Often merely a change of position is sufficient to quiet
him. Do not take him up at the first cry; most babies like to be held
and will often cry simply to be taken up.

=Cry due to colic.= The cry of colic is sharp and spasmodic. The baby
will draw his legs up, and the muscles of the abdomen will be hard and
tense.

=Cry due to hunger.= The normal cry of hunger is heard some time before
the feeding is due, and is accompanied by the sucking of the thumb or
the fingers. If the baby is not getting sufficient nourishment, the
cry of hunger is a continuous fretful sound and is heard soon after a
feeding.

=Cry due to temper.= The cry of temper is loud and strong; the baby
usually kicks, and his body stiffens. This is easily recognized,
because when the baby gets what he wants he will stop at once. When a
baby cries from temper let him cry it out. The struggle will not be
long, because he will soon learn that this crying is useless.

=Cry due to illness or fright.= The cry of most forms of illness is
low, moaning, and fretful. The cry of fright is sudden and loud. The
child should be taken up, comforted, and put down again as soon as he
is quieted. In all cases of persistent crying the doctor should be
called if the mother does not succeed in her attempts at quieting.

=Exercise.= The young baby gets his exercise by crying (which expands
his lungs), also by kicking and waving the arms. It is important that
the clothing should not be so tight as to interfere with these natural
movements.

[Illustration: BABY EXERCISING]

When he is in short clothes, at regular times each day he should be
placed on the floor, on a thick blanket, and allowed to roll and creep
about at will.

Twice a day if possible, but always just before bedtime, the baby
should be placed on a large bed in a warm room with all his clothing
removed, and should be encouraged to kick and play for ten or fifteen
minutes. He may be played with at this time, but must not be permitted
to become excited.




CHAPTER X

THE BABY’S TEETH


  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= =1.= Demonstrate the preparation of
  a baby’s mouth wash. =2.= Demonstrate the care of the baby’s first
  teeth. =3.= Demonstrate the care of the toothbrush and explain the
  necessity for such care.

The best way to secure sound, healthy teeth in a baby is for the mother
during her girlhood to see that her own teeth are in good condition
and to keep well and happy, because it is then that the foundations of
health for life are established. The mother must take the best care of
her teeth at all times and maintain her health in every possible way. A
sickly mother usually means a sickly baby.

The first teeth of the child are called the milk teeth and are twenty
in number. In a normal baby the first tooth usually appears about the
sixth month.

The teeth usually come as follows:

  Two lower central incisors      6 to  9 months
  Four upper incisors             8 to 12 months
  Two lower lateral incisors}
  Four anterior molars      }    12 to 18 months
  Four canines (the “eye” and
    “stomach” teeth)             18 to 24 months
  Four posterior molars          24 to 30 months

=Cleansing the teeth.= As soon as the first tooth appears, it should be
cleansed each day with a small piece of gauze or cotton saturated in a
weak solution of bicarbonate of soda and water. A teaspoonful of water
after each feeding or after taking fruit juice will help to cleanse the
mouth.

=Drooling.= When the baby is about four months old the flow of saliva
is increased. This is an indication that the salivary glands are
developing, and not, as is commonly thought, a sign that the teeth are
trying to push their way through the gums, although this may be the
case.

[Illustration: CHILD BRUSHING HIS TEETH]

=Teething.= Babies nourished by healthy breast milk cut their teeth
earlier than those who are bottle fed. When the teeth begin to come
the gums are apt to be red and swollen. Special care should be taken
at this time to keep the mouth clean. It is a mistake to dread the
teething period and to feel that the baby is sure to be sick. Sickness
at this time usually attributed to teething is more apt to be due to
faulty feeding or to some other condition, and the family physician
should be consulted at once.

=Diet.= Good teeth in a baby depend largely on his diet. During the
first few months of his life, in addition to milk he should be given
fruit juice and meat juice (see Appendix B). As his teeth develop he
should be given food that requires chewing; this is necessary to keep
the teeth and muscles of the jaw strong and healthy.

=Teeth and their care.= By the time the child is two and a half years
old the temporary teeth should be fully developed. These are replaced
by the permanent teeth, which usually begin to appear about the sixth
year. Their condition will largely depend upon the care given to the
first teeth; neglect of the temporary teeth is a frequent cause of
decay in the permanent teeth.

After the teeth come they should be cleansed with a soft brush in the
morning and after the evening meal. A good mouth wash consists of a two
per cent boric acid solution or a weak solution of bicarbonate of soda
and water (one-half teaspoonful to a glass of water).

=Care of the toothbrush.= After being used the toothbrush should be
cleansed with soap and warm water, thoroughly rinsed, and completely
dried. Each day it is well to place the brush in the sunshine.




CHAPTER XI

EMERGENCIES


  =Suggestions for demonstrations.= =1.= Describe the bath thermometer
  and illustrate its use with water at different temperatures. =2.=
  Demonstrate the preparation of an enema and show the correct position
  of the body when taking one. =3.= Show how to protect the baby from
  infection when the mother has a cold.

Babies should be protected from excessive excitement. The brain grows
as much during the first year as it does during the entire remainder of
life. As the baby’s nervous system is easily upset, he should be kept
free from disturbing influences.

=Convulsions.= Anything which upsets the baby’s nervous system may
interfere with the process of digestion. This, as well as improper
food, constipation, or some acute illness may be the cause of
convulsions. When in a convulsion, the baby loses consciousness, the
legs and arms stiffen, and the facial muscles begin to twitch. Send
for a doctor at once. Meanwhile the baby should be placed in a tub of
warm water. If a thermometer is not at hand, some adult should always
test the temperature by placing her arm, up to the elbow, in the water.
Great care should be taken that the water is not too hot, as many
babies have been seriously burned in this way. The temperature of the
water should be slowly raised to 108° F. by adding hot water. A cold
compress should be placed on the child’s head and frequently changed.
When the convulsion ceases the child should be removed from the bath
and wrapped in a warm blanket, and his face should be bathed with cold
water. If necessary, he may be kept in the bath about twenty minutes.
If a child has convulsions and a tub is not available, he should be
wrapped in a large bath towel which has been dipped in water at a
temperature of 104° F., wrapped in a soft blanket, and the face and
hands should be bathed in cold water.

=Colic.= Colic, or a pain in the bowels, is indicated by a sharp,
spasmodic cry, a drawing up of the legs, and a contraction of the
muscles of the face and abdomen. The sufferer should be given a little
warm water to drink and should have a soft, hot flannel placed over the
abdomen and around the feet, or he should be laid on his stomach across
a hot-water bag which is protected by a cloth covering.

[Illustration: BATH THERMOMETER]

=Constipation.= It is important that the mother who is nursing a baby
should have a free movement of the bowels each day; if her bowels are
kept open and her digestion is good, the baby will not, as a rule, be
constipated. A little water given to the baby between feedings will
help to prevent constipation. Fruit juices, such as prune and orange
juice, should also be given. The most effective way of overcoming or
preventing constipation is to develop the habit of having the bowels
move at the same time each day. The baby should not be allowed to go
more than twenty-four hours without a movement. Except in emergency,
however, do not give the baby an enema or suppository or any medicine
unless ordered to do so by a physician.

=Enema.= An enema of two to four ounces of warm water, to which has
been added a little soapsuds and one or two tablespoonfuls of warm
olive oil, will usually cause a movement of the bowels.

=Directions for giving an enema.= Place the baby on his back with a
folded towel under his buttocks. A soft rubber catheter is safer to use
than the hard rubber nozzle provided for this purpose. Allow the water
to run freely through the catheter before inserting, so as to prevent
injecting cold water and air into the rectum. Lift the baby’s feet with
the left hand and with the right insert the oiled catheter gently into
the rectum for two or three inches.

=Diarrhea.= A well baby usually has one or two movements a day.
Frequent movements, or diarrhea, may be the beginning of a severe
illness, and a physician should be consulted at once. This condition
occurs more frequently with bottle-fed babies. If it occurs in a
breast-fed baby, it is usually because the mother has not been careful
about her diet or because the baby has been given improper food.
To relieve this condition, if a physician is not at hand, give one
teaspoonful of castor oil and omit the feeding in order to let the
baby’s stomach rest.

=Prevention of chafing.= The skin of the baby is sensitive and may be
easily irritated. For this reason the baby’s diaper should be removed
as soon as soiled and the skin cleansed with warm water. The folds of
the skin should be thoroughly dried and dusted with a little talcum
powder, or olive oil may be applied, before the clean diaper is put on.

=Colds.= Common colds are contagious and in infants often lead to
serious illness. A mother with a cold, when nursing her baby, should
tie a handkerchief loosely over her nose and mouth in order to protect
the child from infection if she should cough or sneeze. Many children’s
diseases, such as whooping cough, measles, etc., are transmitted
through the secretions of the nose and mouth. Any member of the family
who has a cold should keep away from the children, and particularly
from the baby.

[Illustration: PROTECTING THE BABY FROM HIS MOTHER’S COLD]

=Vaccination.= Before the discovery of vaccine, smallpox was the most
dreaded disease in the world and more prevalent than measles is to-day.
A hundred years ago it was considered a disease of the children;
to-day, by the simple and safe process of vaccination, it has been
almost entirely eliminated, except in those localities where through
prejudice or ignorance the children are not vaccinated. Therefore every
baby should be vaccinated before he is six months old; this should be
repeated at about six years of age, and later if there is a smallpox
epidemic.

The best place for vaccination is on the left arm. If the leg be
selected, as it is occasionally (especially with girls), the child
should stay in bed during the reaction following vaccination.

The aftercare of a vaccinated child is important. A dressing of clean,
sterile gauze should be placed over the point of vaccination and
held in place with strips of adhesive plaster. The dressing should be
changed only by the physician or under his orders. If it sticks to the
scab, it should not be pulled off; the cloth should be cut away around
it and a small piece left adhering to the arm and a fresh dressing
placed over this. Do not apply vaseline or any kind of ointment to the
point of inoculation. Nothing must touch it but clean boiled water and
sterile dressing handled by clean hands.

A vaccinated child should have a bath and a change of underwear daily,
but it is important that the dressing over the vaccination should
be kept clean and dry. The child should not be permitted to play
in gardens, stables, or dusty streets until the arm has completely
healed.




APPENDIX A

ORGANIZATION OF THE GIRLS’ HEALTH LEAGUE CLASSES


I. PRELIMINARY MEETING

The mothers and teachers should be invited and urged to attend the
meeting for the organization of a class. The success of this movement
for the health of our girls and for the saving of our babies depends
largely upon the interest and coöperation of the mothers and teachers.

The organizer should preside, and the school physician should be asked
to explain the object of the league.

At this preliminary meeting membership cards should be distributed to
those desiring to join the class. These are not to be signed until the
girls have taken them home and secured the signatures of their parents
or guardians. While everything possible should be done to make the club
proposition attractive, no girl should be urged to join against her
will. An unwilling member is not a good member.

In order to secure careful personal supervision and free discussion, a
class of not more than twelve is desirable, but as many as twenty-four
may be directed by an experienced teacher.

The form of membership card is given below:

APPENDIX B


RECIPES

=Limewater.= To make limewater, add one teaspoonful of unslaked lime
to one quart of cool, boiled water. Pour into a bottle and shake
thoroughly. Let it stand twenty-four hours; pour off the clear fluid at
the top and strain. Keep in a cool place.

=Barley water.= Mix two teaspoonfuls of barley flour with a little cold
water, then add one quart of water and boil twenty minutes in a double
boiler. Strain through a very fine sieve and add enough boiled water to
make one quart.

=Rice water.= Rice water is made in the same way as barley water, but
only one teaspoonful of rice is used to one quart of water.

=Oatmeal water.= Mix two even tablespoonfuls of oatmeal with a little
cold water; add one quart of water and boil for at least one hour in a
double boiler. Strain through a fine sieve and add enough boiled water
to make one quart.

=Beef juice.= Select the third cut of the round lean beef, broil it
slightly on both sides, cut in small pieces, and squeeze the juice from
it with a potato ricer or a meat press. Add a pinch of salt, and before
using warm it slightly by standing the cup containing the juice in a
dish of hot water.

=Whey.= Warm one pint of fresh milk to about 110° F. Add one
teaspoonful of essence of pepsin or a junket tablet and stir until it
is well mixed. Pour into cups and let stand until it jellies. Then
break up the curds with a fork and strain through a sieve. The liquid
is called whey, and it is sometimes used when babies cannot digest
cow’s milk.

=Two per cent boric acid solution.= Put one teaspoonful of boric acid
powder in a pint of boiling water and keep in a clean bottle.

=Soap suppository.= Take a piece of Ivory or castile soap and cut out a
piece two inches long and about the size of a lead pencil. Narrow to a
dull point at one end.

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

        works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
